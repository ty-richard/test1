Home to an astounding 17 UNESCO World Heritage sites, the city houses over 1,600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines, including the famous golden Kinkaku-ji and the zen garden of Ryoan-ji. The historic Gion district comes alive with geishas hurrying between traditional tea houses along narrow stone-paved streets. Throughout the seasons, Kyoto transforms dramatically: cherry blossoms paint the city pink in spring, while fall brings spectacular red and gold foliage. Traditional experiences abound, from participating in tea ceremonies to staying in ryokan inns, while the modern city offers contemporary art museums, cutting-edge architecture, and innovative cuisine.",
